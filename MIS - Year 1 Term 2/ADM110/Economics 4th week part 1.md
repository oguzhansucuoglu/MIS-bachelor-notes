## 2)Free Market

consumers are free to make demand decisions
firms are free to make supply decisions
no government interventions in economic decisions made by market

### Price Mechanism

When demand increases:

- there will be a shortage when demand exceeds supply
- result of shortage the price would increase
- the producers will produce more because this market will be more profitable since the price is high now.
- at the same time it will discourage the consumers from buying so much
- price will continue to rising until demand balances supply (shortage has been eliminated)

When demand decreases:

- supply will exceed demand there will be a surplus
- Then producers will supply less. Market will be less profitable
- It will encourage consumers to buy more since the price is decreased now
- the price will continue falling until the surplus has been eliminated (until supply and demand equalized)



### "price equilibrium"

the price where demand equals supply is called equilibrium price

demand of good increases -> (demand of good is greater than supply of good / shortage) -> profit of good increases -> supply of good increases and demand of good decreases -> demand of good is equal to supply of good / equilibrium

demand of good decreases -> (supply of good is greater than demand of good / surplus) -> profit of good decreases -> supply of good decreases and demand of good increases -> demand of good is equal to supply of good / equilibrium

### Assessment of Free Market Economy

1) there is no need for costly and complex bureaucracies to coordinate the resources and economic decisions. The economy can respond quickly to changing demand and supply conditions.
2) When market are highly competitive no one has great prices
3) pursude or private gain result in the social good (**main idea**)

### social and economic cost of the free market

1) competition between firms is often limted. a few giant firms may dominate the industry. they may shape high prices and make large profits.
2) lack of competition and high profits may the... (i couldn't write the rest)
3) power and property may be unequally distributed
4) produces of some firms are socially undesirable (chemical waste)
5) socially desirable foods wouldn't be prodcued by private enterprises. (lighthouse)
6) a free market economy may lead to  macroeconomic instability, there may be periods of recession, high unemployment and rising prices (inflation)
7) ethical objection is selfishness, greed and getting power
