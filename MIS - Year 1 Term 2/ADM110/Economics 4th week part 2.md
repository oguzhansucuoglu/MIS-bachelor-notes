## The Mixed Economy

- **Relative prices** (by the use of taxing or subsidising, supporting, them)
- Relative incomes (by the use of income taxes and welfare payments)
- The pattern of production and consumption (by the use of legislation, by the taxes and subsidies or by nationalisation)

# Supply and Demand

## The relationship between demand and price

"Major crap failures in Brazil and east Africa: Coffe Price Soar/Increase"
It is the point prices effect the quantitity/demand/supply
**Law of Demand:** when the price of a good rises, the quantity demanded will fall.  This relationship is known as the law of demand. The two reasons for this law:

- **Income Effect:** The purchasing power of their income (their *real income*) has fallen. People will feel poorer.
- **Substituation Effect:** The goods will now cost more than substitute goods, and people will switch to these goods.

- **Perfect Substitute**
- **Imperfect Substitute**

## Other determinants of demand 

Other than price.

1) *Tastes*. The more desirable people find the good, the more they will demand. 
2) *The number and price of substitute goods.* (If tea goes up in price, the demand for coffe will rise.)
3) *The number and price of complementary goods.* **Complementary goods** are those that are consumed together: cars and petrol, shoes and polish, hamburger and fries.

4. *Income*. As people's income increase, their demand for most goods will rise. Such goods are called **normal goods.** They spend less on **inferior goods,** such as supermarket value ranges, and switch to better quality goods.
5. *Distribution of income.* If national income were redistributed from the poor to the rich, the demand for **luxury goods** would rise. At the same time, as the poor got poorer they might have to buy more inferiror goods, whose demand would thus rise too.
6. *Expectations of future price changes.* If people think that prices are going to rise in the future, they are likely to buy more now before the price does go up. (Imported goods.)
