# Introduction to Economics Midterm Q/A

## 1) Other Determinants of Demand

1) Income
2) Tastes
3) Distribution of Income
4) The number and price of substitute goods
5) The number and price of complementary goods
6) Expectations of future price changes

## 2) Fill the Blanks

1) **Economics** is the science of choosing between alternatives.
2) **A production possibility curve** shows all the possible combinations of two goods that a country can produce within a specified time period with all it's resources fully and efficiently used.
3) The consumers of goods and services are called **households.**
4) When the price of a good rises, the quantity demanded will fall. This relationship is known as the **law of demand.**

## 3) There is a table of price demand supply data and 3 questions about it 

table:

price | quantity demanded | quantity supplied
1,5 |	70	| 10
3	|	60	| 30
4,5 | 50	| 50 -> **equilibrium point and quantities**
6 |	40	| 70
7,5 | 30	| 90

### b) equilibrium point and equilibrium quantity?

**4,5 dollars and 50 quantity**

### c) show the shortage when price is 1.5 dollar on graph

**60 quantity is the shortage**

## 4) sales figures show that your company sold 4000 units sport shoes each month, when they are priced at 50 dollars and 4800 units of sports shoes each month when they are priced at 10 dollars 

### a) what is the linear demand function for sports shoes?

Quantity demanded = a-b.(price)
4000 = a-b.(50)
4800 = a-b.(10)
800 = b.(40)
b=20
a=5000
**Quantity demanded = 5000-20.(price)**

### b) what is the quantity demanded when the price is 5 dollars?

quantity demanded=5000-20.(5)
**4900**
