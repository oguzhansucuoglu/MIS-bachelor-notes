# Economics 5th Week

### Price

- tastes
- price and number of substitute goods
- price and number of company goods
- income
- distribution of income

## Movements along and shifts in the demand curve

 a demand curve is constructed on the assumption that other things remain equal "ceteris paribus" . it is assumed that none of the determinants of demand, other than price, changes!
What happens, then, when one of the other determinants does change?
We have to construct a whole new demand curve: the curve shifts

**Red: ** a change in one of the other determinants causes demand to rise, the whole curve will shift to the right! (for example if people's income increases)
**Blue:** If a change in one of the other determinants causes demand to fall, the whole curve will shift to the left.(for example if you're selling coffee and price of tea decreases the demand of  coffee might decrease)

1) chnage in demand: the term used for a shift in demand curve it occurs when a determinant of demand other than price changes.
2) change in the quantity demanded, the term used for a movement among the demand curve to a new point

## Simple Demand Functions

Quantity demanded = a - b.(price)
b is slope
a is constant term

The relations between variables are study of econometrics thus not a part of this course.

## Supply and Price

When the price of a good rises, the quantity supplied will also rise. When the price falls, the quantity falls. **Law of supply**

### Reasons of law of supply

1)  when the firms supply more, they will find that after a certain level of output costs rise more and more rapidly. So producers will need to receive a higher price if they produce extra output.
2) The higher price of goods means more profit. Firms will be encouraged to produce **more profitable goods** and they leave the produce of **less profitable goods**.
3) If the price of a good remains high, new producers will be encouraged to set up in production (to join) thus total market supply rises.

### **Other determinants of supply (IMPORTANT LEARN THESE)**

(ALSO LEARN OTHER DETERMINANTS OF DEMAND)

1) **The cost of production:**

   - change in input prices
   - change in technology
   - organizational changes
   - government policy

2) **the profitability of substitute goods**

3) **the profitability of goods in joint supply**

4) **nature "random shocks" and other unpredictable events**

5) **the aims of products**

6) **expectation of future prices**

7) **the number of supplies, firms, companies**

8) **Change in supply**(other determinants)

   ​		whole curve shifts left or right

9) **Change in quantity supplied/price**

   ​			from A to B

### Simple supply functions

quantity soled = a + b.(price)
