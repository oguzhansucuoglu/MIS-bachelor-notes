# Final Notes for Economics

## Markets In Action

------

The government intervenes in the market

1. fixing prices
2. taxing the products
3. Subsidising the products (public transport)
4. producing directly
5. regulation (e.g. laws against the production of unsafe toys, dumping toxic waste)

### The Control of Prices

Government may keep prices above/below the equilibrium.

#### Minimum Price - Price Floor

If the government sets a minimum price above the equilibrium, there will be a surplus.

#### Maximum Price - Price Ceiling

If the government sets a maximum price below the equilibrium, there will be a shortage.

#### Setting a minimum/high price

Price won't fall below a certain level. Reasons might be:

1. to protect producers' incomes (if the industry is subject to fluctuations)
2. to create a surplus so we can store things for possible shortages.
3. minimum wage 

#### methods to deal with the surpluses caused by minimum prices

1. the government can buy and store or destroy or sell the surplus
2. limiting producers to quotas can lower supply
3. raising demand by advertising

#### problems of minimum price

- firms with surpluses on their hands may try to avoid price control and cut their prices.
- high prices may cause inefficiency. firms may become less efficient to produce since their profit is protected by some external force.

#### Setting a maximum/low price

price won't go above a level. reasons might be:

- fairness.
- in times of food scarcity, for poor people to afford the basic goods.

#### resulting shortage creates further problems

1. "first come, first served" resulting in long queues
2. firms deciding which customers should be allowed to buy

solving these two problems government may start rationing. 

#### Underground markets

- major problem of maximum price
- maximum price reduce the production of already scarce commodity.

to minimise these problems the government can encourage supply: by direct government production or by giving subsidies (A subsidy or government incentive is a form of financial aid or support ) or tax relief to firms
or it may reduce demand: by producing more alternative goods or by controlling people's incomes.

#### rent control

another example of maximum prices is to make rented accommodation more affordable. danger of this policy is the shortage of rental property.

### Indirect Taxes

such as value added tax (VAT) and duties on tobacco, alcoholic drinks and petrol.
fixed amount per unit sold - a **specific tax**. An example is the tax per liter of petrol
percentage of the price or value added at each stage of production - an **ad valorem tax.** an example is VAT.

#### effect of a tax on the supply curve

curve shifting upwards by the amount of the tax.
price will not  rise by the full amount of the tax

#### government rejection of market allocation



1. providing goods and services free at the point of delivery such as treatment
2. goods and services forbidden to sale like drugs and weapons

A country’s **balance of payments** account records
all transactions between the residents of that country
and the rest of the world. These transactions enter as either **debit items or**
**credit items.**
**The debit items** include all payments to other
countries: these include the country’s purchases of
imports, the investments it makes abroad and the
interest and dividends paid to people abroad who
have invested in the country
**The credit items** include all receipts from other
countries: these include the sales of exports, inflows
of investment into the country and earnings of
interest and dividends from abroad.

The sale of exports and any other receipts earn foreign currency. The
purchase of imports or any other payments abroad use up foreign
currency. If we start to spend more foreign currency than we earn, one of
two things must happen. Both are likely to be a problem.

1) The balance of payments will go into deficit. 
2) The exchange rate will fall. The exchange rate is the rate at which
   one currency exchanges for another. For example, the exchange rate
   of the pound into the dollar might be $1 = TL 13.94

government macroeconomic goals

- high and stable economic
  growth.

- Low unemployment.

- Low inflation.
- The avoidance of balance of
  payments deficits and excessive
  exchange rate fluctuations.

AD (aggregate demand) is the total spending made within the country (domestically produced g/s)
consumer spending on domestically produced goods and services (Cd)
investment expenditure by firms (I), government spending (G) and the expenditure by residents abroad on this country’s exports (X).
**AD=Cd +I+G+X**

![image-20220612213643320](C:\Users\T420\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220612213643320.png)

Total withdrawals are simply the sum of **net saving**,
net **taxes** and the **expenditure on imports**:
**W=S+T+M**
When, however, people receive benefits from the
government, such as unemployment benefits, child
benefit and pensions, the money flows the other
way. Benefits are thus well matched with a ‘negative
tax’. These benefits are known as **transfer**
**payments**. They transfer money from one group of
people (taxpayers) to others (the recipients).

a) Investment (I) : This is the money that firms spend after obtaining it from various
financial institutions
b) Government Expenditure (G): government spends money on goods and services produced
by firms (roads, hospitals and schools)
c) Export Expenditure (X)
**J=I+G+X**

**The rise in aggregate demand results:**

1. economic growth increase
2. unemployment falls
3. inflation rise
4. balance of payments gets worse, more imports to country less exports outside

If injections exceed with withdrawals, national income will rise, unemployment will tend to fall, inflation will tend to rise, imports will tend to rise and exports fall. The reverse will happen if withdrawals exceed injections.

### **measuring national income and output**

**Gross domestic product (GDP)** The value of output produced within the country over a 12-month period. Ways of measuring GDP:
■ **1)–Product Method**: add up the value of
all the goods and services produced in the
country, industry by industry.
■ **2)–Income Method**: incomes for
households in the form of wages and
salaries, profits, rent and interest.add up all these incomes.
■ **3)–Expenditure Method:** expenditures
necessary to purchase the nation’s
production. with no injections
or withdrawals, whatever is produced is
sold. The value of what is sold must
therefore be the value of what is produced

GDP can be
converted into a common currency at a
**purchasing-power parity rate.**
This is a rate of exchange that would allow a given amount of money
in one country to buy the same amount of goods in another country
after exchanging it into the currency of the other country.
![image-20220612233212982](C:\Users\T420\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220612233212982.png)

**Actual growth** is the percentage annual increase in national output
**Potential growth** is the speed at which the economy could grow *"the economy’s capacity to produce"*
two of the major factors contributing to potential economic growth are:

1) An increase in resources – natural resources, labour or capital.
2) An increase in the efficiency with which these resources are used, through
advances in technology, improved labour skills or improved organisation.

**Potential output** (i.e. potential GDP) is the level of out- put when the
economy is operating at ‘normal capacity utilisation’.
The difference between actual
and potential output is known as
the **output gap**.

**Thus if actual output exceeds**
**potential output, the output gap**
**is positive**: the economy is
operating above normal capacity
utilisation.

**Spare capacity** occurs when a business is not making full use of its
available capacity. When an economy has plenty of spare capacity the output gap is
negative. To close a negative output
gap, the actual growth rate
would have to exceed the
potential growth rate. In
the long run, however, the
actual growth rate will be
limited to the potential
growth rate.

cycle of booms
and recessions is known as the
**business cycle or trade cycle**.
![image-20220613000449073](C:\Users\T420\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220613000449073.png)

Actual growth must be distinguished from potential growth. The
actual growth rate is the percentage annual increase in the
output that is actually produced, whereas potential growth is the
percentage annual increase in the capacity of the economy to
produce.
Actual growth is determined by potential growth and by the level
of aggregate demand. If actual output is below potential output,
actual growth can exceed potential growth,if aggregate demand
is rising sufficiently. In the long term, however, actual output can
grow only as fast as potential output will permit

LONG TERM
ECONOMIC GROWTH
For growth to be sustained over the long term,
there must be an increase in potential output.
There are two main determinants of potential
output:
(a) the amount of resources available and
(b) their productivity.

a) Increases in the quantity of resources: capital, labour,
land and raw materials
■ 1) Capital. The nation’s output depends on its stock of capital (K)
■ An increase in this stock will increase output.
■ The stock of capital will increase by the amount of investment: ΔK = I.
■ 2) Labour. If there is an increase in the working population, there will
be an increase in potential output.
■ This increase in working population may result from a higher
‘participation rate’: a larger proportion of the total population in work
or seeking work. (women with children deciding to rejoin the labour
market, people retiring later and people working part time deciding to
work longer hours)
■ 3) Land and raw materials. Land is virtually fixed in quantity. But the
new materials are important for the long term growth.

b)
Increases
in the
productivit
y of
resources
Technological improvements can
increase the marginal
productivity of capital.
Modern computers can do the
work of many people and have
replaced many machines that
were expensive to build.
Improved methods of transport
have reduced the costs of moving
goods and materials.
Improved communications (such
as email and the Internet) have
reduced the costs of transmitting
information.
But technical progress on its own is not
enough. There must also be the
institutions and attitudes that
encourage innovation. In other words,
the inventions must be exploited

■ First, they may focus on the demand side
or the supply side of the economy. In
other words, they may attempt to create
sufficient aggregate demand to ensure
that firms wish to invest and that
potential output is realised.
Alternatively they may seek to increase
aggregate supply by concentrating on
measures to increase potential output:
measures to encourage research and
development, innovation and training.
**Second**, they may be market-
orientated or interventionist policies.
Many economists and politicians,
believe that the best environment for
encouraging economic growth is one
where private enterprise is allowed to
grow: where entrepreneurs are able to
get significant rewards from
investment in new techniques and
new products.

## Money and banking system

changes in the money supply affect the economy
supply of
money and the demand for money
between them determine the **rate of**
**interest**, and this has an important
impact on aggregate demand and
the performance of the economy
generally.

### Interest rate

When customers leave money in a bank, the bank pays the customer
for the use of that money in the form of interest. The amount of
interest paid is determined by the interest rate, which is usually a
percentage of the total amount of money in the customer's account.
The same thing occurs when a customer borrows money from a bank.
You pay the money back with interest. (Additional money as a "thank
you" for letting me borrow)
■ In fact the **main component of a country’s money supply** is not cash,
but **deposits in banks and other financial institutions**.
■ Only a very small proportion of these **deposits is kept** by the banks in
the form of cash. The bulk of the deposits appear as **bookkeeping**
entries in the banks’ accounts.

### **THE FUNCTIONS OF MONEY**

1) **A medium of exchange**
2) **A means of storing wealth**
3) **A means of evaluation**
4) **A means of establishing the value of future claims and payments**

Money is commonly referred to as currency. Money is a liquid asset used in the settlement of transactions.
The current value of monetary currency is not necessarily derived from
the materials used to produce the note or coin. Instead, value is derived
from the willingness to agree to a displayed value and rely on it for use
in future transactions.
![image-20220613014804868](C:\Users\T420\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220613014804868.png)

**Commodity money** is the simplest and the oldest type of money. gold coins, beads, shells,
spices, etc.
 **FIAT MONEY** coins and bills
**COMMERCIAL BANK MONEY	**	(commercial bank money is created through what we
call fractional reserve banking. Fractional reserve banking describes a process where commercial
banks give out loans worth more than the value of the actual currency
they hold.) debt generated by commercial banks that
can be exchanged for “real” money or to buy goods and services.

## THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM

Banks and other financial institutions are known as **financial**
**intermediaries.** financial
institutions (banks, building societies, mutual funds, pension funds,
life insurance companies etc.) which act as a means of channelling
funds from depositors to borrowers.

![image-20220613015155875](C:\Users\T420\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220613015155875.png)

**maturity transformation**:	It bor-
rows money from a vast number of small savers, who are
able to withdraw their money on demand or at short notice.
It then lends the money to house purchasers for a long
period of time by granting mortgages (typically these are
paid back over 20 to 30 years). This process whereby finan-
cial intermediaries lend for longer periods of time than
they borrow is known as maturity transformation. They
are able to do this because with a large number of deposi-
tors it is highly unlikely that they would all want to with-
draw their deposits at the same time. On any one day,
although some people will be withdrawing money, others
will be making new deposits.

### BANKING SYSTEM

■ Retail Banking
■ Wholesale Banking
■ Universal Banks
**Retail banking** operates bank accounts for individuals and
businesses, attracting deposits and granting loans at
**published rates of interest**.
**Wholesale banking** where banks deal in large-scale deposits and
loans, mainly with **companies** and **other banks and financial**
**institutions.** Interest rates and charges may be **negotiable**.

**Liabilities**: Customers’ **deposits in banks** are liabilities to these
institutions
 This means simply that the customers have the claim on these
deposits and thus the institutions are liable to meet the claims.
four major types of **deposit**: sight **deposits, time deposits,**
**certificates of deposit and ‘repos’.**
■ **Sight deposits** are any deposits that can be withdrawn on demand
by the depositor without penalty
■ **Time deposits** require notice of withdrawal. With some types of
account, a depositor can withdraw a certain amount of money on
demand, but there will be a penalty of so many days’ lost interest
■ **Certificates of deposit** are certificates issued by banks to
customers (usually firms) for large deposits of a fixed term (e.g. £100
000 for 18 months). They can be sold by one customer to another,
and thus provide a means whereby the holders can get money quickly
if they need it without the banks that have issued the CDs having to
supply the money.
■ **Sale and repurchase agreements (repos)**: If banks have a
temporary shortage of funds, they can sell some of their financial
assets to other banks or to the central bank. And later repurchase
them on some agreed date. These sale and repurchase
agreements (repos) are in effect a form of loan – the bank
borrowing for a period of time using some of its financial assets as the
security for the loan.
**Assets**: A bank’s financial assets are its **claims on others**. There are
three main categories of assets.
■ Cash and reserve balances in the central bank
■ Short-term loans.
■ Longer-term loans
Banks need to hold a certain **amount of their assets as cash**. This is
largely used to meet the day-to-day demands of customers. They also
keep ‘reserve balances’ in the central bank.
market loans, bills of exchange or reverse
repos. The market for these various types of loan is known as the
**money market**
loans to customers, both personal customers and
businesses. (fixed- term, overdrafts, outstanding balances on credit-card accounts, mortgages)

# INFLATION

**decline of purchasing power** of a given currency
over time.the general level of prices for goods and services is
rising. contrasted with deflation, which occurs when the
purchasing power of money increases and prices decline.

## CONSUMER PRICE INDEX (CPI)

metric that measures
inflation by calculating the price change for a **basket of**
**goods.** The government publishes a consumer prices index (CPI)
(TÜFE) each month, and the rate of inflation is the percentage
increase in that index over the previous 12 months.

• A basket of goods is a constant set of general
goods produced in an economy whose prices are
tracked over time.
• basic food, beverages such as milk, and coffee.
• housing costs, bedroom furniture, apparel,
transportation expenses, medical care costs,
recreational expenses, toys, and the cost of
admissions to museums also qualify.
• Education and communication
• Tobacco, haircuts, and funerals.

## PRODUCER PRICE INDEX (PPI)

group of indexes that
calculates and represents the average movement in selling
prices from domestic production over time.
measure of inflation based on input costs to producers
• If people could correctly anticipate the
rate of inflation and fully adjust prices
and incomes to take account of it, then
the costs of inflation would indeed be
relatively small.
• For firms, they would again be the
relatively minor costs of having to
change price labels, or prices in
catalogs or on menus, or adjust slot
machines. These are known as **menu**
**costs**.

![image-20220613032711832](C:\Users\T420\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220613032711832.png),![image-20220613033209581](C:\Users\T420\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220613033209581.png)

**Demand-pull inflation** is caused by continuing rises in
aggregate demand. Firms will respond to a rise in demand partly by raising prices
and partly by increasing output. How much they raise prices depends on how much their costs
rise as a result of increasing output.

![image-20220613033951420](C:\Users\T420\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220613033951420.png)

**Cost-push inflation** is associated with continuing rises in
costs and hence continuing leftward (upward) shifts in the AS
curve. Such shifts occur when costs of production rise independently
of aggregate demand.If firms face a rise in costs, they will respond partly by raising
prices and passing the costs on to the consumer, and partly by
cutting back on production.![image-20220613034946314](C:\Users\T420\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220613034946314.png)

![image-20220613035156392](C:\Users\T420\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220613035156392.png)

### STRUCTURAL (DEMAND-SHIFT) INFLATION

When the pattern of demand (or supply) changes in the economy,
certain industries will experience increased demand and others
decreased demand. If prices and wage rates are inflexible downwards in the contracting
industries, and prices and wage rates rise in the expanding industries,
the overall price and wage level will rise. Thus a more rapid structural change in the economy can lead to both
increased structural unemployment and increased structural inflation.

Workers and firms take account of the expected rate of inflation when
making decisions.

## POLICIES TO TACKLE INFLATION

1) **DEMAND-SIDE POLICIES**

**Fiscal policy** involves altering the level of government expenditure and/or
rates of tax. Aggregate demand can be reduced by **cutting government**
**expenditure** or by **raising taxes and hence reducing consumer expenditure**.
These are both examples of **contractionary (or deflationary) fiscal policy.**
Fiscal policy could also be used to **boost aggregate demand** if there were a
problem of demand-deficient unemployment. In this case, the government
would **raise government expenditure** and/or **cut taxes**. This is called
**expansionary (or reflationary) fiscal policy**

**Monetary policy** involves altering the supply of money in the economy or
manipulating the rate of interest. The central bank can **reduce aggregate**
**demand** by **putting up interest rates and thus making borrowing more**
**expensive**, or by acting to **reduce the supply of money** available through the
banking system. **If people borrow less, they will spend less**.

2) **SUPPLY-SIDE POLICIES**

The aim here is to reduce the rate of increase in costs.

1.  by restraining monopoly influences on prices and incomes or
2.  by designing policies to increase productivity.

**PHILLIPS CURVE**

inflation and
unemployment have a
stable and
inverse/opposite
relationship.

• Higher inflation is
associated with lower
unemployment

The theory claims that
with economic growth
comes inflation, which
in turn should lead to
more jobs and less
unemployment.
The belief in the 1960s was that any fiscal stimulus would increase
aggregate demand and initiate some effects;
Labor demand increases,
The pool of unemployed workers later decreases,
Companies increase wages to compete and attract a smaller talent pool,
The corporate cost of wages increases,
Companies pass along those costs to consumers in the form of price
increases.
This belief system caused many governments to adopt a "stop-go" strategy
where a target rate of inflation was established, and fiscal and
monetary policies were used to expand or contract the economy to achieve
the target rate.
However, the stable trade-off between inflation and unemployment broke
down in the 1970s with the rise of **stagflation**, calling into question the
validity of the Phillips curve
**stagflation** or **recession-inflation** is a situation in which **the inflation rate is high, the economic growth rate slows, and unemployment remains steadily high.**

![image-20220613041154753](C:\Users\T420\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220613041154753.png)

![image-20220613041200689](C:\Users\T420\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220613041200689.png)

### DEFLATION

When the overall price level decreases so that inflation rate
becomes negative, it is called deflation. It is the opposite of the
often-encountered inflation.A reduction in money supply or credit availability is the reason
for deflation in most cases. Reduced investment spending by government or individuals
may also lead to this situation.Deflation leads to a problem of increased unemployment due
to slack in demand.

### RECESSION

A recession is a macroeconomic term that
refers to a significant decline in general
economic activity in a region.It has been typically recognized as two
consecutive/serial quarters of economic
decline.Recessions are visible in industrial production,
employment, real income, and wholesale-retail
trade.

# financial system

**A financial asset** is a paper claim that entitles the buyer to future income from the seller.
**Financial markets** are where households **invest** their current savings and their accumulated
**savings**, or **wealth**, by **purchasing** **financial assets**.
A household can also invest its current savings or wealth by purchasing a **physical asset**,
a claim on a **tangible object, such as a preexisting house or preexisting piece of**
**equipment.**
![image-20220613043603924](C:\Users\T420\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220613043603924.png)

## Types of Financial Assets

1) **Loans,**
2) **Bonds,**
3) **Stocks,**
4) **Bank deposits**

A **loan** is a **lending agreement** between a particular lender and a particular borrower
A **bond** is a **promise** by the seller to **pay interest each year** and to repay the principal to the owner of the bond on a **particular date**..
An important advantage of bonds is that they are easy to **resell**.
This provides **liquidity** to bond purchasers. Indeed, a bond will often pass through many hands before it finally comes due.
**Loans is less liquid than bonds.**
A **stock** is a **share** in the **ownership of a company**.

Not all companies sell shares of their
stock; “privately held” companies are
owned by an individual or a few partners,
who get to keep all of the company’s
profit.
Most large companies, however, do sell
stock

**a**
**portion of a public**
**corporation.** 
ownership in a publicly-
traded company. When
you buy a company's
stock, you become part-
owner of that company.
if a company
has 100,000 shares, and
you buy 1,000 of them,
you own 1% of the
company. Owning stocks
**allows you to earn more**
**from the company's**
**growth** and gives you
**shareholder voting rights.**
![image-20220613044542845](C:\Users\T420\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220613044542845.png)

The **first time** a company issues **stocks to the public** is called the **"initial**
**public offering" (IPO).**  **stock market**—where prices are driven by supply and demand.
When the company offers more stock for sale, the stock price will reduce.
When more people buy the company's stock, the stock price will increase.
Generally, people buy or sell stocks based on expectations of corporate
earnings or profits. If traders think a company's earnings are high or will rise
further, they bid up/raise the price of the stock.
One way shareholders make a return on
their investment is by **selling shares at a**
**higher price than where they were**
**purchased.**
The **profit made from selling a stock** is
known as "**capital gains**.»
The other way **shareholders profit** is
through **dividends**, which are quarterly
**payments distributed on a per-share basis**
**out of a company's earnings**

## Stocks Versus Bonds

**A bond is a promise while a stock is a hope** by law, a company must
pay what it owes its lenders before it distributes any profit to its
shareholders. And if the company should fail (that is, be unable to pay its interest
obligations and declare bankruptcy), its physical and financial assets
go to its bondholders—its lenders—while its shareholders generally
receive nothing.So although a stock generally provides a higher return to an investor
than a bond, it also carries higher risk.

## FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES

A financial intermediary is an institution
that **transforms funds gathered from many**
**individuals into financial assets**. The most important types of financial
intermediaries are **mutual funds, pension**
**funds, life insurance companies, and banks**.

A bank works by first accepting funds from
**depositors**: when you put your money in a
bank, you are essentially becoming a **lender**
by lending the bank your money.
In return, you receive credit for a **bank**
**deposit**—**a claim on the bank**, which is
obligated to give you your cash if and when
you demand it.
So a **bank deposit is a financial asset** owned
by the **depositor** and a **liability of the bank**
**that holds it.**

### How can a bank manage the liquid needs?

**The bank counts on the fact that, on average, only a small fraction of**
**its depositors will want their cash at the same time. On any given day,**
**some people will make withdrawals and others will make new**
**deposits; these will roughly cancel each other out**. So the bank needs
to keep only a limited amount of cash on hand to satisfy its
depositors.
In addition, if a bank becomes financially unable to paying its
depositors, individual bank deposits are guaranteed to depositors by
the national bank

## liquidity

An asset is **liquid** if it can be
**quickly converted into cash**,
**without much loss of value**, and it
is **illiquid if it cannot**.

## how banking system works

**Required Reserve Ratio**:
**A required reserve ratio** is the
**fraction of deposits** that **regulators**
**require a bank to hold in reserves**
and **not loan out.**
If the required reserve ratio is 1 to
10, that means that a bank must
hold $10 of each 100 dollars it has
in deposit in reserves, but can
loan out $90 of each 100 dollars.

# UNEMPLOYMENT

Number **unemployed** is those of working age who are without work, but who are
available for work at current wage rates.
The **labour force** is defined as those in employment plus those unemployed

###  CLAIMANT UNEMPLOYMENT

Those in receipt of unemployment-related benefits.
The following categories of people are ineligible for benefits and are thus
not included in claimant unemployment:
People returning to the workforce (e.g. after raising children).
Those who are on government training schemes (e.g. school leavers
without jobs).
People over 55. If such people are out of work, the benefit they receive is
not regarded as ‘unemployment- related’.
People seeking part-time work, rather than full-time work, for example
students.

### STANDARDISED UNEMPLOYMENT RATES

• For disequilibrium unemployment to occur, two conditions
must hold;
• The aggregate supply of labour must exceed the aggregate
demand.
• There must be a ‘stickiness’ in wages. In other words, the wage
rate must not immediately fall to We, the market-clearing
wage.![image-20220613071243247](C:\Users\T420\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220613071243247.png)

**Frictional (search)**
**unemployment** occurs when
people leave their jobs, either
voluntarily or because they are
sacked, and are unemployed for
a period of time while they are
looking for a new job.
• Employers searching for the
right labour and workers
searching for the right jobs.
**Structural unemployment**
occurs where the structure of the
economy changes. Employment
in some industries may expand
while in others it contracts.
• Main Reasons;
A change in the pattern of
demand
A change in the methods of
production (technological
unemployment) - ‘labour-saving
technical progress’. Structural unemployment often
occurs in particular regions of the
country. When it does, it is referred to as
**regional unemployment.**

#### The Level Of Structural Unemployment Will Depend On Three Factors

:• **The degree of regional concentration of industry**. -The more that industries
are concentrated in particular regions, the greater will be the level of
structural unemployment if particular industries decline-
• **The speed of change of demand and supply in the economy**. -The more
rapid the rate of technological change or the shift in consumer tastes, the
more rapid will be the rate of redundancies-
• **The immobility of labour**.
**Seasonal unemployment**
occurs when the demand for
certain types of labour fluctuates
with the seasons of the year.
• **Touristic regions**
**• Agricultural seasons**.
