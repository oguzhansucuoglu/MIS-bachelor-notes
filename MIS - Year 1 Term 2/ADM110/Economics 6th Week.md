(demand always downward and supply always upwards sloping)
supply=demand is equilibrium point, market clearing point

You can sell 90 pens per week, if they are made at $1 each. But only 30 each week, if they are made at $2 per pen. Our pen supplier is prepared to sell you 20 pens each week if they are made at $1 per and 100 each if they are made at $2 per pen. 
a) write down the associated linear demand and supply functions.

90=a-b
30=a-2b
b=60
a=150
demand function is
Qd=150-60p
-
20=a+b
100=a+2b
b=80
a=-60
supply function is
Qs=-60+80p

b) At what price should the pens be made so that there is neither a surplus nor a shortage of pens?

Qd=Qs
150-60p=-60+80p
140p=210
p=1.5$

	income effect
	substitution effect are the two reasons for 	law of demand
