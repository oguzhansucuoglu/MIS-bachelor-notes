## 1) Production Possibility Curve

A curve showing all the possible combination **of two goods** that **a country** can produce within an **specific time period** with all its **resources fully and efficiently** employed. (We are using all of our resources.)

### Table:

Max possible combinations of two goods that a country can produce within a year/food and clothing

**Units of food** | **Units of Clothing**

8.0 millions |	0.0 (if country produce 8 millions food there will be no resources for producing clothing.)

7.0 m. |	2.2 (if country produces 8 million food country can produce 2.2 million clothing)

6.0 m | 4.0 

0.0 m|	7.0  (if country produce 8 millions clothing there will be no resources for producing food.)

*A production possibility curve is shown in Figure 1.1. The graph is based on the data shown in Table 1.1.*

Assume that some imaginary nation devotes all its resources – land, labour and capital – to producing just two goods, food and clothing. Various possible combinations that could be produced over a given period of time (e.g. a year) are shown in the table.

Production is not possible at the point w: the nation doesn't have enough resources to do this. Any point inside the curve will be unefficient.

- A production possibility curve illustrates the microeconomic issues of choice and opportunity cost. If the country choose to produce more clothing, it would have to sacrifice the production of some food!
- The production of food is **the opportunity cost** of extra clothing.

If country moves from point x to point y, it would be producing extra 1 million units of clothing but 1 million units less of food. Thus the **opp. cost of the 1 million extra units of clothing would be the 1 million units of forgone.**

This graph also illustrates the phenomenon of **increasing opp. costs.** A country produces more of one good it has to sacrifice ever-increasing amounts of the other. In this example the production of more and more clothing will involve a growing *marginal cost: ever increasing amounts of food have to be sacrificed for each additional unit of clothing produced.*

##### Macroeconomics and the production possibility curve

Over time, the production possibilities of a nation are likely to increase. **Investment** in new plant and machinery will increase the stock of capital; new raw materials may be discovered; technological advances are likely to take place; through education and training labour is likely to become more productive. This growth in potential output is shown like this: (by shifting the curve outwards)

## 2) The Circular Flow of Goods and Incomes

The consumers of g/s are labelled households. The producers of g/s are labelled "firms"

The money flows from households to firms in the form of consumer expenditure, while goods and services flow the other way - from firms to households. Households earn incomes from firms and firms earn incomes from households. The money circulates. Households supply goods and services to households. 

Firms and households are together in markets. 

Firms supply goods and households demand goods.

In factors of production, firms demand them and households supply them.

**Services of factors of production: labour, etc**

Microeconomics is concerned with composition of the circular flow: what combinations of goods make up the goods flow; how the various factors of production are combined to produce these goods; for whom the wages, dividends, rent an interest are paid out.

Macroeconomics is concerned with the total size of flow and what causes it to expand and contract.

# Different Economic Systems

## The classification of economics systems

### 1) Planned/Command Economy

All economic decisions are taken by the government. Allocation of resources at three important level:

- It plans the allocation of resources between current consumption and investment for the future.
- At macroeconomic level it plans,
  - the output of each industry and firm
  - the techniques that will be used
  - the labour and other resources required by each industry 
  - In order to ensure that the required inputs are available, the state would probably conduct some form of **Input-output analysis.** 
-  It plans the distribution of output between consumers.

#### Assessment of the command economy

1) High growth rates could be achieved if the government directed large amounts of resources into investment.
2) Unemployment could be largely avoided if the government carefully planned the allocation of labour in accordance with production requirements and labour skills.
3) national income could be dstributed more equally or in accordance with needs/wishes. 

#### Social and economic cost of planned economy

1) The larger and more complex economy will be difficult for collecting and analyzing the information to planning.
2) Complicated plans are likely to be costly to administer and involve **bureaucracy**. 
3) If there is no system of prices, or if prices are set by the state, planning is likely to include inefficient use of resources.
4) It's difficult to encourage the workers, managers or farmers to be more productive without a reduction in quality. **(general objection about communism/socialism)** 
5) Complete state control over resources allocation would involve a significant loss of individual liberty. 
6) The government might enforce it's plans over even if they were unpopular.

### 2) Free Market Economy

There is no government intervention. All economic decisions are taken by individual households and firms.

### 3) Mixed Economy

Economic decisions are made partly by the government and partly through the market.
