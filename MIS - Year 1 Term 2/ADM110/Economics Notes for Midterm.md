# Economics Notes



Studying economics shows us how people make decisions like what to buy or what job to do or governmental decisions like tax management.  

Some fundamental economic ideas that are very simple can be applied to a wide range of economic problems.

**Economics is concerned about:**

- The production of goods and services. How much is produced and how many people are employed.
- The consumption of goods and services. How much has been spent and saved, how consumption is affected by prices and other factors.
- Scarcity. 

**The main ingredient that makes a problem and economic one is "scarcity".**
